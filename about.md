I slap keyboards professionally: I teach software development in the Galvanize immersive program in San Francisco. The program focuses on NodeJS, AngularJS, React, SQL, jQuery, Javascript, HTML/CSS and computer science fundamentals. 

I have the pleasure of helping a group of students who are do-ers, and who want to make a change in their lives, to become highly skilled full stack web developers. 

I also wear funny hats, make terrible programming puns, and break into song and dance at random intervals.
